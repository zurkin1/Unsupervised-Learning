# Welcome to My Unsupervised Learning Project Page

Welcome to my unsupervised learning project page! Below, I provide links to two exciting projects that explore the use of unsupervised techniques for solving real-world problems in medical imaging. Each project leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures and data-driven approaches to address unique challenges. 

## Projects

### [1. Unsupervised Learning Using Tumor Cell Images](./ul.md)
In this project, inspired by the work of Doersch et al. ([arXiv:1505.05192](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05192)), I trained an unsupervised neural network on cellular image data from a recent Kaggle competition. The goal was to predict four types of human cells. The project demonstrates the feasibility of applying unsupervised methods to real-world problems, especially in cases where labeled data is scarce or unavailable. It combines neural networks and statistical clustering techniques.

### [2. Unsupervised White Blood Cell Detection](./code/wbc.ipynb)
This project tackles the challenge of identifying white blood cell types and matching treatments to individual patients using a dataset of blood cell images. The dataset includes images and XML files with bounding box annotations, along with subcategory labels in a CSV file. Using a ResNet50 model pretrained on ImageNet, I developed an unsupervised approach to detect and classify white blood cells without relying on the provided labels, adhering to the task's constraints.
